# A backport of Spatie's Laravel-ActivityLog

This is a backport package that allows Laravel-ActivityLog to work with PHP 5.6.  By design the namespace of the original project has been left untouched `Spatie\Activitylog`.  This allows for full use of the documentation with only minor modifications:

### Installation
Change
``` bash
composer require spatie/laravel-activitylog
```
to
``` bash
composer require linearsoft/laravel-activitylog
```

For your convenience the Activity facade infrastructure has been restored in this backport.
All you need to do is register the facade:

```php
// config/app.php
'aliases' => [
    ...
    'Activity' => Spatie\Activitylog\ActivitylogFacade::class,
];
```

### Testing

All testing has been stripped from the backport version.

### Bugs or features requests

For the most part most all bugs & requests should be submitted to the [Spatie Team](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-activitylog/issues). And the fixes/features will eventually be backported into this project.

If, however, you found a problem specifically with the backport version please it via [GitHub](https://github.com/LinearSoft/entrust-cli/issues)

### Licensing

The licensing has been modified from MIT to the GPLv3 License - see the `LICENSE` file for details.
You are requested, however, to still follow the Postcardware "requirements" of the original package.

#### Log activity inside your Laravel app

The `spatie/laravel-activity` package provides easy to use functions to log the activities of the users of your app. It can also automatically log model events. All activity will be stored in the `activity_log` table.

Here's a litte demo of how you can use it:

```php
activity()->log('Look, I logged something');
```

You can retrieve all activity using the `Spatie\Activitylog\Models\Activity` model.

```php
Activity::all();
```

Here's a more advanced example:
```php
activity()
   ->performedOn($anEloquentModel)
   ->causedBy($user)
   ->withProperties(['customProperty' => 'customValue'])
   ->log('Look, I logged something');
   
$lastLoggedActivity = Activity::all()->last();

$lastLoggedActivity->subject; //returns an instance of an eloquent model
$lastLoggedActivity->causer; //returns an instance of your user model
$lastLoggedActivity->getExtraProperty('customProperty'); //returns 'customValue'
$lastLoggedActivity->description; //returns 'Look, I logged something'
```


Here's an example on [event logging](https://docs.spatie.be/laravel-activitylog/v1/advanced-usage/logging-model-events).

```php
$newsItem->name = 'updated name';
$newsItem->save();

//updating the newsItem will cause an activity being logged
$activity = Activity::all()->last();

$activity->description; //returns 'updated'
$activity->subject; //returns the instance of NewsItem that was created
```

Calling `$activity->changes` will return this array:

```php
[
   'attributes' => [
        'name' => 'updated name',
        'text' => 'Lorum',
    ],
    'old' => [
        'name' => 'original name',
        'text' => 'Lorum',
    ],
];
```
